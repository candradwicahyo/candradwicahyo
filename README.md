# Introducing


introduce, my name is **candra dwi cahyo**, I come from **Indonesia** and I was born in **East Java, Malang**.  I am a **frontend web developer**.  I learned the first programming language in 2018, at which time I learned about **PHP**.  I started switching to **JavaScript** in 2020 because I didn't feel right as a **backend web developer**.  and finally I focused on learning about **javascript** until now.

*  html
*  css
